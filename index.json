Deciphering T cell loss of functionality is complicated by the conspicuous heterogeneity of CD8 T cell states described across experimental and clinical settings. By carrying out a unified analysis of over 300 assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing (ATAC-seq) and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) experiments from 12 studies of CD8 T cells in cancer and infection, we defined a shared differentiation trajectory toward dysfunction and its underlying transcriptional drivers and revealed a universal early bifurcation of functional and dysfunctional T cell states across models. Experimental dissection of acute and chronic viral infection using single-cell ATAC (scATAC)-seq and allele-specific single-cell RNA (scRNA)-seq identified state-specific drivers and captured the emergence of similar TCF1+ progenitor-like populations at an early branch point, at which functional and dysfunctional T cells diverge.

However, these methods are technically challenging and not easily applicable to an in vivo setting. To overcome these limitations and facilitate the investigation of miRNA functions in vivo, we have developed a method based on a genetically engineered mouse harboring a conditional Halo-Ago2 allele expressed from the endogenous Ago2 locus. By using a resin conjugated to the HaloTag ligand, Ago2-miRNA-mRNA complexes can be purified from cells and tissues expressing the endogenous Halo-Ago2 allele. We demonstrate the reproducibility and sensitivity of this method in mouse embryonic stem cells, developing embryos, adult tissues, and autochthonous mouse models of human brain and lung cancers.

Here we explored Foxp1 function in Treg cells. We found that a large number of Foxp3-bound genomic sites in Treg cells were occupied by Foxp1 in both Treg cells and conventional T cells (Tconv cells). In Treg cells, Foxp1 markedly increased Foxp3 binding to these sites. Foxp1 deficiency in Treg cells resulted in their impaired function and competitive fitness, associated with markedly reduced CD25 expression and interleukin-2 (IL-2) responsiveness, diminished CTLA-4 expression and increased SATB1 expression. The characteristic expression patterns of CD25, Foxp3 and CTLA-4 in Treg cells were fully or partially rescued by strong IL-2 signaling. Our studies suggest that Foxp1 serves an essential non-redundant function in Treg cells by enforcing Foxp3-mediated regulation of gene expression and enabling efficient IL-2 signaling in these cells.","tags":null,"title":"Transcription factor Foxp1 regulates Foxp3 chromatin binding and coordinates regulatory T cell function","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Colleen M Lau","Nicholas M Adams","Clair D Geary","Orr-El Weizman","Moritz Rapp","Yuri Pritykin","Christina S Leslie","Joseph C Sun"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1535760000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1535760000,"objectID":"4b4e1bb93f774113c8b868b0f846c705","permalink":"https://pritykinlab.github.io/publication/2018-nat-immunol-epigenetic/","publishdate":"2018-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2018-nat-immunol-epigenetic/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Epigenetic control of innate and adaptive immune memory","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Clair D Geary","Chirag Krishna","Colleen M Lau","Nicholas M Adams","Sofia V Gearty","Yuri Pritykin","Allan R Thomsen","Christina S Leslie","Joseph C Sun"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1534809600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1534809600,"objectID":"f405834e81cf4763d8c350531159db8d","permalink":"https://pritykinlab.github.io/publication/2018-cell-reports-nk/","publishdate":"2018-08-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2018-cell-reports-nk/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Non-redundant ISGF3 components promote NK cell survival in an auto-regulatory manner during viral infection","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Orr-El Weizman","Nicholas M.

In Drosophila, piRNAs are produced from discrete regions of the genome termed piRNA clusters, whose expression relies on the RDC complex comprised of the core proteins Rhino, Deadlock, and Cutoff. To date, the RDC complex has been exclusively implicated in the regulation of the piRNA loci. Here we further elucidate the function of Cutoff and the RDC complex by performing genome-wide ChIP-seq and RNA-seq assays in the Drosophila ovaries and analyzing these data together with other publicly available data sets. In agreement with previous studies, we confirm that Cutoff is involved in the transcriptional regulation of piRNA clusters and in the repression of transposable elements in germ cells. Surprisingly, however, we find that Cutoff is enriched at and affects the expression of other noncoding RNAs, including spliceosomal RNAs (snRNAs) and small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs). At least in some instances, Cutoff appears to act at a transcriptional level in concert with Rhino and perhaps Deadlock. Finally, we show that mutations in Cutoff result in the deregulation of hundreds of protein-coding genes in germ cells. Our study uncovers a broader function for the RDC complex in the Drosophila germline development.","tags":null,"title":"Integrative analysis unveils new functions for the Drosophila Cutoff protein in non-coding RNA biogenesis and gene regulation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alexendar R Perez","Yuri Pritykin","Joana A Vidigal","Sagar Chhangawala","Lee Zamparo","Christina S Leslie","Andrea Ventura"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1488326400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1488326400,"objectID":"a689dc79aeb7a5220dfa0e8df00a2bd0","permalink":"https://pritykinlab.github.io/publication/2017-nat-biotech-guide-scan/","publishdate":"2017-03-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2017-nat-biotech-guide-scan/","section":"publication","summary":"We present GuideScan software for the design of CRISPR guide RNA libraries that can be used to edit coding and noncoding genomic regions.

We begin by re-examining an influential but controversial characterization of the dynamic modularity of the *S. cerevisiae* interactome that incorporated gene expression data into network analysis. We analyse the protein-protein interaction networks of five organisms, *S. cerevisiae*, *H. sapiens*, *D. melanogaster*, *A. thaliana*, and *E. coli*, and confirm significant and consistent functional and structural differences between hub proteins that are co-expressed with their interacting partners and those that are not, and support the view that the former tend to be intramodular whereas the latter tend to be intermodular. However, we also demonstrate that in each of these organisms, simple topological measures are significantly correlated with the average co-expression of a hub with its partners, independent of any classification, and therefore also reflect protein intra- and inter- modularity. Further, cross-interactomic analysis demonstrates that these simple topological characteristics of hub proteins tend to be conserved across organisms.

Identifying multifunctional genes at the genome-wide level and studying their properties can shed light upon the complexity of molecular events that underpin cellular functioning, thereby leading to a better understanding of the functional landscape of the cell. However, to date, genome-wide analysis of multifunctional genes (and the proteins they encode) has been limited. Here we introduce a computational approach that uses known functional annotations to extract genes playing a role in at least two distinct biological processes. We leverage functional genomics data sets for three organisms—H. sapiens, D. melanogaster, and S. cerevisiae—and show that, as compared to other annotated genes, genes involved in multiple biological processes possess distinct physicochemical properties, are more broadly expressed, tend to be more central in protein interaction networks, tend to be more evolutionarily conserved, and are more likely to be essential. We also find that multifunctional genes are significantly more likely to be involved in human disorders. These same features also hold when multifunctionality is defined with respect to molecular functions instead of biological processes. Our analysis uncovers key features about multifunctional genes, and is a step towards a better genome-wide understanding of gene multifunctionality.","tags":null,"title":"Simple Topological Features
