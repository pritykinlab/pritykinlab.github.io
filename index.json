While neonates receive maternal protection, they can also independently combat pathogens, although the mechanisms remain unknown. Using the sugar glider (Petaurus breviceps) as a model, we investigated immunological defense strategies of marsupial neonates. Cathelicidins—a family of antimicrobial peptides expanded in the genomes of marsupials—are highly expressed in developing neutrophils. Sugar glider cathelicidins reside in two genomic clusters, and their coordinated expression is achieved by enhancer sharing within clusters and long-range physical interactions between clusters. Functionally, cathelicidins modulate immune responses and have potent antibacterial effects, sufficient to provide protection in a mouse model of sepsis. Evolutionarily, cathelicidins have a complex history, with marsupials and monotremes uniquely retaining both clusters among tetrapods. Thus, cathelicidins are critical mediators of marsupial immunity, and their evolution may reflect the life history–specific immunological needs of these animals.","tags":[],"title":"Cathelicidin antimicrobial peptides mediate immune protection in marsupial neonates","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Henri Schmidt","Minsi Zhang","Dimitar Chakarov","Vineet Bansal","Haralambos Mourelatos","Francisco J.

In adult mice, autophagy sustains metabolism to prevent wasting by cachexia and to survive fasting, and also suppresses inflammation, liver steatosis, neurodegeneration, and lethality. Defects in autophagy contribute to metabolic, inflammatory and degenerative diseases, however, the specific mechanisms involved were unclear. Here we profiled metabolism and inflammation in adult mice with conditional, whole-body deficiency in an essential autophagy gene and found that autophagy deficiency altered fuel usage, and reduced ambulatory activity, energy expenditure, and food intake, and elevated circulating GDF15, CXCL10, and CCL2. While deletion of Gdf15 or Cxcl10 provided no or mild benefit, deletion of Ccl2 restored food intake, suppressed cachexia and rescued lethality of autophagy-deficient mice. To test if appetite suppression by CCL2 was responsible for lethal cachexia we performed single nucleus RNA sequencing of the hypothalamus, the center of appetite control in the brain. Notably, we found that autophagy deficiency was specifically toxic to PMCH and HCRT neurons that produce orexigenic neuropeptides that promote food intake, which was rescued by deficiency in CCL2. Finally, the restoration of food intake via leptin deficiency prevented lethal cachexia in autophagy-deficient mice. Our findings demonstrate a novel mechanism where autophagy prevents induction of a cachexia factor, CCL2, which damages neurons that maintain appetite, the destruction of which may be central to degenerative wasting conditions.","tags":[],"title":"Autophagy Suppresses CCL2 to Preserve Appetite and Prevent Lethal Cachexia","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Stanislav Dikiy","Aazam P.

Analysis of Treg cell adaptations to non-lymphoid tissues that enable their specialized immunosuppressive and tissue-supportive functions raises questions about the underlying mechanisms of these adaptations and whether they represent stable differentiation or reversible activation states. Here, we characterize distinct colonic effector Treg cell transcriptional programs. Attenuated T cell receptor (TCR) signaling and acquisition of substantial TCR-independent functionality seems to facilitate the terminal differentiation of a population of colonic effector Treg cells that are distinguished by stable expression of the immunomodulatory cytokine IL-10. Functional studies show that this subset of effector Treg cells, but not their expression of IL-10, is indispensable for colonic health. These findings identify core features of the terminal differentiation of effector Treg cells in non-lymphoid tissues and their function.","tags":[],"title":"Terminal differentiation and persistence of effector regulatory T cells essential for preventing intestinal inflammation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Davide Pradella","Minsi Zhang","Rui Gao","Melissa A Yao","Katarzyna M Gluchowska","Ylenia Cendon-Florez","Tanmay Mishra","Gaspare La Rocca","Moritz Weigl","Ziqi Jiao","Hieu HM Nguyen","Marta Lisi","Mateusz M Ozimek","Chiara Mastroleo","Kevin Chen","Felix Grimm","Jens Luebeck","Shu Zhang","Andrea Alice Zolli","Eric G Sun","Bhargavi Dameracharla","Zhengqiao Zhao","Yuri Pritykin","Carlie Sigel","Howard Y Chang","Paul S Mischel","Vineet Bafna","Cristina R Antonescu","Andrea Ventura"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1734480000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1734480000,"objectID":"820dca07d80eb1264226da867f298e17","permalink":"https://pritykinlab.github.io/publication/2025-ecdna/","publishdate":"2024-12-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2025-ecdna/","section":"publication","summary":" Focal gene amplifications are among the most common cancer-associated mutations but have proven challenging to engineer in primary cells and model organisms. Here we describe a general strategy to engineer large (more than 1 Mbp) focal amplifications mediated by extrachromosomal DNAs (ecDNAs) in a spatiotemporally controlled manner in cells and in mice. By coupling ecDNA formation with expression of selectable markers, we track the dynamics of ecDNA-containing cells under physiological conditions and in the presence of specific selective pressures. We also apply this approach to generate mice harbouring Cre-inducible *Myc*- and *Mdm2*-containing ecDNAs analogous to those occurring in human cancers. We show that the engineered ecDNAs spontaneously accumulate in primary cells derived from these animals, promoting their proliferation, immortalization and transformation. Finally, we demonstrate the ability of *Mdm2*-containing ecDNAs to promote tumour formation in an autochthonous mouse model of hepatocellular carcinoma.

The approach uses regularized Poisson regression on tile-level accessibility data to jointly model all regulatory effects at a gene locus, avoiding the limitations of pairwise gene–peak correlations and dependence on peak calling. SCARlink outperformed existing gene scoring methods for imputing gene expression from chromatin accessibility across high-coverage multi-ome datasets while giving comparable to improved performance on low-coverage datasets. Shapley value analysis on trained models identified cell-type-specific gene enhancers that are validated by promoter capture Hi-C and are 11× to 15× and 5× to 12× enriched in fine-mapped eQTLs and fine-mapped genome-wide association study (GWAS) variants, respectively.

Pooled, noncoding CRISPR screens offer a systematic approach to investigate cis-regulatory mechanisms. The ENCODE4 Functional Characterization Centers conducted 108 screens in human cell lines, comprising 540,000 perturbations across 24.85 megabases of the genome. Using 332 functionally confirmed CRE–gene links in K562 cells, we established guidelines for screening endogenous noncoding elements with CRISPR interference (CRISPRi), including accurate detection of CREs that exhibit variable, often low, transcriptional effects. Benchmarking five screen analysis tools, we find that CASA produces the most conservative CRE calls and is robust to artifacts of low-specificity single guide RNAs. We uncover a subtle DNA strand bias for CRISPRi in transcribed regions with implications for screen design and analysis. Together, we provide an accessible data resource, predesigned single guide RNAs for targeting 3,275,697 ENCODE SCREEN candidate CREs with CRISPRi and screening guidelines to accelerate functional characterization of the noncoding genome.","tags":[],"title":"Multicenter integrated analysis of noncoding CRISPRi screens","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sandra Nakandakari-Higa","Sarah Walker","Maria C.

To study these ‘kiss-and-run’ interactions directly in vivo, we previously developed LIPSTIC (labelling immune partnerships by SorTagging intercellular contacts), an approach that uses enzymatic transfer of a labelled substrate between the molecular partners CD40L and CD40 to label interacting cells. Reliance on this pathway limited the use of LIPSTIC to measuring interactions between CD4+ T helper cells and antigen-presenting cells, however. Here we report the development of a universal version of LIPSTIC (uLIPSTIC), which can record physical interactions both among immune cells and between immune and non-immune populations irrespective of the receptors and ligands involved. We show that uLIPSTIC can be used, among other things, to monitor the priming of CD8+ T cells by dendritic cells, reveal the steady-state cellular partners of regulatory T cells and identify germinal centre-resident T follicular helper cells on the basis of their ability to interact cognately with germinal centre B cells. By coupling uLIPSTIC with single-cell transcriptomics, we build a catalogue of the immune populations that physically interact with intestinal epithelial cells at the steady state and profile the evolution of the interactome of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus-specific CD8+ T cells in multiple organs following systemic infection. Thus, uLIPSTIC provides a broadly useful technology for measuring and understanding cell–cell interactions across multiple biological systems.","tags":[],"title":"Universal recording of immune cell interactions in vivo","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The uLIPSTIC paper is published in Nature, with Yuri as co-corresponding author!

While tTreg cells suppress autoimmunity, pTreg cells enforce tolerance to food and commensal microbiota. However, the role of Foxp3 in pTreg cells and the mechanisms supporting their differentiation remain poorly understood. Here, we used genetic tracing to identify microbiota-induced pTreg cells and found that many of their distinguishing features were Foxp3 independent. Lineage-committed, microbiota-dependent pTreg-like cells persisted in the colon in the absence of Foxp3. While Foxp3 was critical for the suppression of a Th17 cell program, colitis, and mastocytosis, pTreg cells suppressed colonic effector T cell expansion in a Foxp3-independent manner.

In the present study, we examined how the activities of eight major transcription factor (TF) families are integrated to shape the epigenome of naive and activated CD4 and CD8 T cells. By leveraging extensive polymorphisms in evolutionarily divergent mice, we identified the ‘heavy lifters’ positively influencing chromatin accessibility. Members of Ets, Runx and TCF/Lef TF families occupied the vast majority of accessible chromatin regions, acting as ‘housekeepers’, ‘universal amplifiers’ and ‘placeholders’, respectively, at sites that maintained or gained accessibility upon T cell activation. In addition, a small subset of strongly induced immune response genes displayed a noncanonical TF recruitment pattern.

In this study, we found that ectopic expression of microRNA-200c (miR-200c) markedly enhanced the antitumor activity of CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) during ACT in multiple mouse models. CTLs transduced with miR-200c exhibited reduced apoptosis during engraftment and enhanced in vivo persistence, accompanied by up-regulation of the transcriptional regulator T cell factor 1 (TCF1) and the inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF). miR-200c elicited these changes by suppressing the transcription factor Zeb1 and thereby inducing genes characteristic of epithelial cells. Overexpression of one of these genes, *Epcam*, was sufficient to augment therapeutic T cell responses against both solid and liquid tumors. These results identify the miR-200c–EpCAM axis as an avenue for improving ACT and demonstrate that select genetic perturbations can produce phenotypically distinct T cells with advantageous therapeutic properties.","tags":[],"title":"Ectopic activation of the miR-200c–EpCAM axis enhances antitumor T cell responses in models of adoptive cell therapy","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1630454400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1630454400,"objectID":"260c3a311c90ed86b96155eecf14a11d","permalink":"https://pritykinlab.github.io/post/2021-09-01-biocondensate/","publishdate":"2021-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2021-09-01-biocondensate/","section":"post","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Pritykin lab receives funding from Princeton Biomolecular Condensate Program with the Levine lab","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1627776000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1627776000,"objectID":"3e706e3b7732ee3035b34d96aff69f37","permalink":"https://pritykinlab.github.io/post/2021-08-01-three-students/","publishdate":"2021-08-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2021-08-01-three-students/","section":"post","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Three QCB students, Amanda Sun, Sarah Walker and Gabe Dolsten, join the lab","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1625097600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1625097600,"objectID":"fdd875e38ec45c388cf723796c88a6cf","permalink":"https://pritykinlab.github.io/post/2021-07-01-rutgers-new-investigator/","publishdate":"2021-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2021-07-01-rutgers-new-investigator/","section":"post","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Pritykin Lab receives New Investigator Award from Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey","type":"post"},{"authors":["Yuri Pritykin","Joris van der Veeken","Allison Pine","Yi Zhong","Merve Sahin","Linas Mazutis","Dana Pe’er","Alexander Rudensky","Christina Leslie"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1619049600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1619049600,"objectID":"34e407fc64f793152242c2c7454e65ca","permalink":"https://pritykinlab.github.io/publication/2021-cd8t/","publishdate":"2020-08-28T02:34:03-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2021-cd8t/","section":"publication","summary":"CD8 T cells play an essential role in defense against viral and bacterial infections and in tumor immunity.

Experimental dissection of acute and chronic viral infection using single-cell ATAC (scATAC)-seq and allele-specific single-cell RNA (scRNA)-seq identified state-specific drivers and captured the emergence of similar TCF1+ progenitor-like populations at an early branch point, at which functional and dysfunctional T cells diverge.

During infectious challenges, naive T cells encountering their cognate antigen become activated and differentiate into highly proliferative effector T cells. Despite their evident metabolic shift upon activation, it remains unclear how effector T cells respond to changes in nutrient availability in vivo. Here, we show that spontaneous or imposed feeding reduction during infection decreases the numbers of splenic lymphocytes. Effector T cells showed cell-intrinsic responses dependent on the nuclear receptor Farnesoid X Receptor (FXR). Deletion of FXR in T cells prevented starvation-induced loss of lymphocytes and increased effector T cell fitness in nutrient-limiting conditions, but imparted greater weight loss to the host. FXR deficiency increased the contribution of glutamine and fatty acids toward respiration and enhanced cell survival under low-glucose conditions. Provision of glucose during anorexia of infection rescued effector T cells, suggesting that this sugar is a limiting nutrient for activated lymphocytes and that alternative fuel usage may affect cell survival in starved animals. Altogether, we identified a mechanism by which the host scales immune responses according to food intake, featuring FXR as a T cell-intrinsic sensor.","tags":[],"title":"FXR mediates T cell-intrinsic responses to reduced feeding during infection","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xiaoyi Li","Yuri Pritykin","Carla P Concepcion","Yuheng Lu","Gaspare La Rocca","Minsi Zhang","Bryan King","Peter J Cook","Yu Wah Au","Olesja Popow","Joao A.Paulo","Hannah G Otis","Chiara Mastroleo","Paul Ogrodowski","Ryan Schreiner","Kevin M Haigis","Doron Betel","Christina S Leslie","Andrea Ventura"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1593648000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1593648000,"objectID":"eda8a1745a7f7f913a965f0de796cdec","permalink":"https://pritykinlab.github.io/publication/2020-mol-cell-heap/","publishdate":"2020-08-28T00:40:47-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2020-mol-cell-heap/","section":"publication","summary":"The identification of microRNA (miRNA) targets by Ago2 crosslinking-immunoprecipitation (CLIP) methods has provided major insights into the biology of this important class of non-coding RNAs.

The characteristic expression patterns of CD25, Foxp3 and CTLA-4 in Treg cells were fully or partially rescued by strong IL-2 signaling.

In Drosophila, piRNAs are produced from discrete regions of the genome termed piRNA clusters, whose expression relies on the RDC complex comprised of the core proteins Rhino, Deadlock, and Cutoff. To date, the RDC complex has been exclusively implicated in the regulation of the piRNA loci. Here we further elucidate the function of Cutoff and the RDC complex by performing genome-wide ChIP-seq and RNA-seq assays in the Drosophila ovaries and analyzing these data together with other publicly available data sets. In agreement with previous studies, we confirm that Cutoff is involved in the transcriptional regulation of piRNA clusters and in the repression of transposable elements in germ cells. Surprisingly, however, we find that Cutoff is enriched at and affects the expression of other noncoding RNAs, including spliceosomal RNAs (snRNAs) and small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs). At least in some instances, Cutoff appears to act at a transcriptional level in concert with Rhino and perhaps Deadlock. Finally, we show that mutations in Cutoff result in the deregulation of hundreds of protein-coding genes in germ cells. Our study uncovers a broader function for the RDC complex in the Drosophila germline development.","tags":null,"title":"Integrative analysis unveils new functions for the Drosophila Cutoff protein in non-coding RNA biogenesis and gene regulation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alexendar R Perez","Yuri Pritykin","Joana A Vidigal","Sagar Chhangawala","Lee Zamparo","Christina S Leslie","Andrea Ventura"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1488326400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1488326400,"objectID":"a689dc79aeb7a5220dfa0e8df00a2bd0","permalink":"https://pritykinlab.github.io/publication/2017-nat-biotech-guide-scan/","publishdate":"2017-03-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2017-nat-biotech-guide-scan/","section":"publication","summary":"We present GuideScan software for the design of CRISPR guide RNA libraries that can be used to edit coding and noncoding genomic regions.

We leverage functional genomics data sets for three organisms—H. sapiens, D. melanogaster, and S. cerevisiae—and show that, as compared to other annotated genes, genes involved in multiple biological processes possess distinct physicochemical properties, are more broadly expressed, tend to be more central in protein interaction networks, tend to be more evolutionarily conserved, and are more likely to be essential. We also find that multifunctional genes are significantly more likely to be involved in human disorders. These same features also hold when multifunctionality is defined with respect to molecular functions instead of biological processes. Our analysis uncovers key features about multifunctional genes, and is a step towards a better genome-wide understanding of gene multifunctionality.","tags":null,"title":"Simple Topological Features
